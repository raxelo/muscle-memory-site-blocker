# Muscle memory site blocker

> Helps you avoid visiting sites that you don't really want to visit

I wanted to create a simple website to remind myself if I really want to visit twitter, youtube, etc.

Whenever typing "tw" or "y" on the URL bar, youtube appeared first, and because of muscle memory, I found myself on youtube or other social media sites without actually knowing what I'm doing.

So I developed this simple website and deployed it to https://twitter.lucas.am/ to help me avoid doing that.
